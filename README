== Introduction ==

IrssiGrowl is a simple plugin script for Irssi, that will allow you to receive
notifications on your OS X desktop. This is useful if, like me, you use irssi
for IRC in a shell on your Mac, and wish to receive notifications of mentions
or PM activity when using a different application on a different space.

You could also use it if, for example, you have a linux box on your network
that you use for IRC, and connect from a Mac... the linux box could run the
script, and send the Growl notifications to the remote Mac.

I tried to install Mac::Growl on my x86_64 Snow Leopard install, and it failed
so I looked at Net::Growl... this, actually, provides for a better solution
(for me, anyway) due to the ability to do the second scenario listed above.


== Requirements ==

* Net::Growl and any pre-requisit modules it requires.


== Installation ==

Grab growl.pl, and drop it in ~/.irssi/scripts/

If you want it to autorun, copy, or symlink it to ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

You can load it manually with /script load growl


== Configuration ==

There are two settings, currently, as follows:

  - growl_password

    This is used to set the password the used to talk to Growl, and should be
    the same password you set on the Mac in Growl's network settings.

  - growl_host

    This is the host you wish to send notifications to. Defaults to 'localhost'.

  - growl_sticky

    This defines which notifications should be 'sticky'. Can be set to:

    - mention or hilight
      When your nick is mentioned in a channel

    - priv or pm
      When someone says something to you in a PM

    - all or both
      As it says, really...

    - Anything else is treated as 'none' and the notifications won't be sticky.

If you change these settings, you seem to need to reload the script. I don't know if
there's a way around this or not, and as it's a set-it-and-forget-it type setting
I'm not going to spend ages looking into it right now.

== Known Issues ==

The Net::Growl module doesn't seem to make sticky notifications actually sticky.

I've tested this on my install of Snow Leopard.

It seems the Net::Growl module doesn't set the flag correctly, and so I've patched
it to do so. I've tested the patch and it seems to work (again, for me, in my
environment).

I'll attempt to submit my patch to the Net::Growl author, in the mean time, I'll
make it available for download.

I read http://the.taoofmac.com/space/projects/netgrowl.php which indicated that
0x100 was correct (256 in decimal) rather than 0x0001. 

With the change in place, notifications correctly become sticky.

== Support, Requests, etc ==

Currently, it seems to do what I want, and I regret that at the current time,
time is very short, so modifying it is unlikely unless I find it's broken for me.

If you want a new feature, by all means ask, and I'll see what I can do.

If it's broken, by all means tell me, and I'll see what I can do.

If you have the skills and modify it, by all means send me a patch.
