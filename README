== Introduction ==

IrssiGrowl is a simple plugin script for Irssi, that will allow you to receive
notifications on your OS X desktop. This is useful if, like me, you use irssi
for IRC in a shell on your Mac, and wish to receive notifications of mentions
or PM activity when using a different application on a different space.

You could also use it if, for example, you have a linux box on your network
that you use for IRC, and connect from a Mac... the linux box could run the
script, and send the Growl notifications to the remote Mac.

I tried to install Mac::Growl on my x86_64 Snow Leopard install, and it failed
so I looked at Net::Growl... this, actually, provides for a better solution
(for me, anyway) due to the ability to do the second scenario listed above.


== Requirements ==

* Net::Growl and any pre-requisit modules it requires.


== Installation ==

Grab growl.pl, and drop it in ~/.irssi/scripts/

If you want it to autorun, copy, or symlink it to ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

You can load it manually with /script load growl


== Configuration ==

There are two settings, currently, as follows:

  - growl_password

    This is used to set the password the used to talk to Growl, and should be
    the same password you set on the Mac in Growl's network settings.

  - growl_host

    This is the host you wish to send notifications to. Defaults to 'localhost'.


== Support, Requests, etc ==

Currently, it seems to do what I want, and I regret that at the current time,
time is very short, so modifying it is unlikely unless I find it's broken for me.

If you want a new feature, by all means ask, and I'll see what I can do.

If it's broken, by all means tell me, and I'll see what I can do.

If you have the skills and modify it, by all means send me a patch.
